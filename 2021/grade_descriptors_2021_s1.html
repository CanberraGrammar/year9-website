<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-middle"><p class="tableblock">The student demonstrates a thorough knowledge of core programming concepts and their implementation in the C# programming language. They have a very good working knowledge of Unity to develop 2D games with physics capabilities. The student displays very good creativity and ingenuity to design a series of minigames and story sequences. The student has demonstrated that they are able to design and develop a reasonably complex Unity game from scratch, along with having the requisite project management skills to ensure that the task is completed within the given timeframe and constraints. To improve, the student should further develop their knowledge of using advanced Unity features, and their understanding of game design principles.</p></td>

They are able to use Unity to develop 2D games with some physics capabilities, but need substantial guidance and structured steps. The student displays limited creativity and their design of minigames and story sequences lack detail. The student has some knowledge of Unity, but encounters difficulties when implementing and using this technology. To improve, the student should further develop their knowledge of using advanced Unity features, and their understanding of game design principles. They should also practise project management skills in terms of developing a more complex game from scratch.</p></td>
