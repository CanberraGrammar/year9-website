^.^|*A*
.^|The student demonstrates an extensive knowledge of core programming concepts and their implementation in the Swift programming language. They have mastered the use of SpriteKit to develop 2D games with full physics capabilities. The student displays exceptional creativity and ingenuity to design a purposeful series of minigames and story sequences. The student has demonstrated that they are able to design and develop a complex SpriteKit game from scratch, along with having the requisite project management skills to ensure that the task is completed within the given timeframe and constraints.

^.^|*B*
.^|The student demonstrates a thorough knowledge of core programming concepts and their implementation in the Swift programming language. They have a very good working knowledge of SpriteKit to develop 2D games with physics capabilities. The student displays very good creativity and ingenuity to design a series of minigames and story sequences. The student has demonstrated that they are able to design and develop a reasonably complex SpriteKit game from scratch, along with having the requisite project management skills to ensure that the task is completed within the given timeframe and constraints. To improve, the student should further develop their knowledge of using advanced SpriteKit features, and their understanding of game design principles.

^.^|*C*
.^|The student demonstrates a sound knowledge of core programming concepts and their implementation in the Swift programming language. With guidance, they are able to use SpriteKit to develop 2D games with some physics capabilities. The student displays creativity and ingenuity to design a series of minigames and story sequences. The student has demonstrated that they are able to design and develop a SpriteKit game from scratch. To improve, the student should further develop their knowledge of using advanced SpriteKit features, and their understanding of game design principles. They should also practise project management skills in terms of developing a more complex game from scratch.

^.^|*D*
.^|The student demonstrates a limited knowledge of core programming concepts and their implementation in the Swift programming language. They are able to use SpriteKit to develop 2D games with some physics capabilities, but need substantial guidance and structured steps. The student displays limited creativity and their design of minigames and story sequences lack detail. The student has some knowledge of SpriteKit, but encounters difficulties when implementing and using this technology. To improve, the student should further develop their knowledge of using advanced SpriteKit features, and their understanding of game design principles. They should also practise project management skills in terms of developing a more complex game from scratch.

^.^|*E*
.^|The student demonstrates a very limited knowledge of core programming concepts and their implementation in the Swift programming language. They have some understanding of SpriteKit, but require substantial guidance and step-by-step instruction. Their design of minigames and story sequences were incomplete and did not demonstrate creativity. To improve, the student should further develop their knowledge of using SpriteKit features, and their understanding of game design principles.

^.^|*S*
.^|Awarded to students who have been unable to complete sufficient work due to an extended period of illness or other approved absence (status).

=== Absence from Class

It is your responsibility to catch up on work missed when absent from class. We suggest you email your teacher on the day you are away to request any missed work or information.

If you are away for an assessment, please consult your teacher to make arrangements to complete the assessment as soon as possible after you return to school. After 10 school days, the assessment cannot be rescheduled and either an estimate (in the case of an explained absence) or a zero will be awarded.

For assignments and non-test events a late work penalty of 10% of the total possible mark will be incurred for each day late if work is not submitted on the due date.  A loss of 30% is incurred if work due on a Friday is not submitted until the following Monday. After one week (7 days) the item will be awarded a mark of zero.

=== All My Own Work

Please note that any submitted work is to be your own. There are serious consequences for submitting work which is taken from another person, even if they give it to you voluntarily. To decide if you have written the material, we may need to question you about your understanding of the topic. Please be careful when presenting ideas which are not entirely your own; reference such material thoroughly.

For more specific examples, see the <<course_overview/course_overview.adoc#academic-honesty, Academic Honesty>> section of the Course Outline.
